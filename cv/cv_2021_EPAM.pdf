Application for Software Developer Go
Dear Hiring Manager,
I apply with enthusiasm for the Java Software Developer role at Epam.
As well as being a valuable addition to your team and company,
I am certain this would be an exceptional opportunity for me
to grow both professionally and personally at an international company.

Currently, now Iâ€™m interning at rt.com. This experience has allowed me
to acquire multiple important abilities which you described as crucial
in the job ad for the above-mentioned role on LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/reriver/),
such as Golang(https://www.hackerrank.com/certificates/f6549f406aff),
C, REST API. I am a detail-oriented leader offering exceptional analytical
skills and the important ability to function well in fast-paced environments.
In Jan 2020 I was offered a job and I mastered Kotlin in 2 weeks
at hyperskills and worked till december. We were developing iOS fitness
app(https://apps.apple.com/us/app/champions-fitness-center/id1456139231)
using OpenCV, PoseEstimationForMobile. Besides developing in 2020 I passed
the entrance exams and went to study at the international computer school (Ecole 42)
where I was ranked in the top 10% of students. I was using c, git, valgrind, vim, gcc.
I have never broken deadlines.

On top of my experience, I am a holder of a bachelor's degree in math from the MIEM HSE.
In addition to being a native Russian speaker, I am fluent in English plus basic Spanish. 
On the tech side, I am skilled in using Golang(https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-webservices-1),
C, C++, Java(https://hyperskill.org/), git, SQL(sql-ex.ru), Redis(https://university.redis.com/),

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you regarding my application.
Yours faithfully,
Georgy Kryukov
